# CLM Component Registry
# Based on Cubic Logic Model (CLM) - 三套東西 (Three Sets)
#
# Core Principle: Each component is a function f(goal, process) → output
# 
# Three Sets Structure:
#   1. Abstract (Context): The situation/environment - "contact"
#   2. Concrete (Goal): The objective/implementation - "goal"  
#   3. Balanced (Success): The outcome/metrics - "success"
#
# Details are represented as hash values (URLs) pointing to:
#   - Images, nested models, complex documents, etc.
#   - The context itself can be a very long article
#
# Note: "hash" field represents the unique identifier (can be actual hash or semantic ID)
# Each component is isolated in iframe for failure containment

    concept: "Church Encoding"
    specification: |
      Church numerals encode natural numbers as Lambda terms:
      
      0 = λf.λx.x
      1 = λf.λx.f x
      2 = λf.λx.f (f x)
      n = λf.λx.f^n x  (f applied n times)
      
      Successor: SUCC = λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)
      Addition: ADD = λm.λn.λf.λx.m f (n f x)
      
      All numerals are closed terms (no free variables).

      numeral: "\\f.\\x.f (f x)"  # Church 2
    expected_output:

  - name: "Church 1"
    description: "One - single application"
    input:
      expression: "\\f.\\x.f x"
    expected_output:
      closed: true
      normalForm: true
      churchValue: 1
      
  - name: "Church 2"
    description: "Two - double application"
    input:
      expression: "\\f.\\x.f (f x)"
    expected_output:
      closed: true

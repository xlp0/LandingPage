abstract:
  purpose: Check availability and status of all polyglot runtimes
  description: "This PCard checks the availability of all 6 polyglot runtimes (Python,\
    \ JavaScript, \nRust, C, WASM, Lean). It uses a content-addressed approach with\
    \ fallback mechanism:\n1. First attempts to load implementation from MCard using\
    \ code_hash\n2. Falls back to loading from file if MCard is not available\n"
  inputs:
    trigger:
      type: string
      description: Trigger for runtime check (any value)
  outputs:
    runtime_status:
      type: dict
      description: Detailed status for all runtimes
  preconditions:
  - PTREngine must be initialized
  postconditions:
  - Returns runtime status for all 6 runtimes
  - Ensures at least one runtime is available

  runtime: python
  operation: custom

  test_cases:
  - given: check
    when:
      operation: custom
    then:
      runtime_status:

  expectations:
    performance:
      max_time_ms: 1000
    quality:
      correctness: verified
    safety:
    - Must ensure at least one runtime is available

    description: "Pull MCards from a remote sync server"

  concrete:
    runtime: network
    manifestation: "HTTP Sync Pull"
    builtin: mcard_sync
    config:
      url: "http://localhost:3001/sync"
      mode: "pull"

  balanced:
    expectation: "Successfully sync when server is available"
    description: |
      This CLM requires a running sync server on localhost:3001.
      To test manually:
        1. Start the sync server: npm --prefix mcard-js run clm:all -- chapter_07_network/sync_server.yaml
        2. Then run this client: npm --prefix mcard-js run demo:clm -- chapters/chapter_07_network/sync_client.yaml

# No examples - requires external server to be running
# This CLM is skipped in automated tests but can be tested manually
